MorSTORM: MATLAB-based platform for morphological quantification of super-resolved single molecules

MorSTORM is an integrated MATLAB-based platform designed for the quantitative analysis of super-resolution imaging data. The platform streamlines the entire workflow for single-molecule localisation, drift correction, and morphological quantification, enabling robust and reproducible analysis of SMLM datasets.

By consolidating widely-used algorithms such as ThunderSTORM for localisation, AIM-based drift correction, and MorphoLibJ for morphological analysis, MorSTORM provides a unified and user-friendly environment that supports both novice and advanced users. The platform is highly flexible, allowing integration of additional algorithms for extended functionality, and is ideal for users aiming to perform detailed morphological characterisation of biological structures, including protein aggregates and molecular complexes, directly from super-resolution reconstructions.

Key features include:

Seamless integration of localisation, drift correction, and morphology analysis

Adaptive drift correction algorithm (AIM) for improved tolerance to low localisation density

Quantification of key morphological descriptors (e.g., area, perimeter, Feret diameter)

Simple and modular design, suitable for users with minimal computational expertise

Customizable for future expansion

Explore, modify, and contribute to MorSTORM to enhance quantitative super-resolution imaging analysis.
